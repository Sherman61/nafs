# Agent Instructions

- Prefer TypeScript and Next.js conventions already used in the project.
- Keep authentication-sensitive API calls defensive: handle missing or invalid tokens gracefully to avoid server errors in UI routes.
- Provide clear test commands run (or explain why not run) in your final summary.
